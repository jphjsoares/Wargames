This code uses a XOR cipher. For us to exploit this code we need the key to the XOR cipher. Although, the XOR operator is vulnerable to a "known-plaintext-attack", since a plaintext and a ciphertext are present. And then "plaintext XOR ciphertext = key".

Being that: 
    Plain text -> array("showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff")
    Cipher text -> is the cookie itself, you can grab it with burpsuite
    
By using the plain text as key and passing in the base64 decoded cookie we can get the key.

Now using the key given in the key field and passing in the base64 decoded cookie we will get the plain text.

Now we can pass in the array we want to encrypt (with the showpassword => yes) and we will get the cookie needed to get the password for the next level!
