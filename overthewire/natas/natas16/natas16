For this challenge we have command injection again, although this time there's even more filtering. 
Although they do not filter all chars, we can actually execute commands using command substitution [$()]

Okay so we already know how to execute commands, so, how can we make this work?

So lets try to do the following $(grep 1 /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)

All the words from the dictionary were returned, so that means that 1 does not exist in the natas17 password file. So we will have to do something similar to what we have done on natas16
A "boolean based injection", we'll try each character against the file we want and if it returns dictionary words, it means it does not exist.
After getting all the chars needed we'll bruteforce it!

(See the python script)

The password will be -> 8Ps3H0GWbn5rd9S7GmAdgQNdkhPkq9cw
