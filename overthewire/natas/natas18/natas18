Natas18 presents us with a different challenge from the ones we've done before.
As we read the source code given we can easily see that we'll have to do some kind of cookie exploitation.

One thing that sticks out though, is that the max id is 640, and that's a really small number for cookies!

So what we can do is change the cookie, one by one, to see which one belongs to the admin.

For that, I made a little python script that will change the cookie on each request and stop when we find the admin one.
