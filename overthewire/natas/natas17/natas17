In natas17 we have a challenge similar to the SQLInjection challenges before. 
Although, now we don't get any response from the website. This is another blind sql injection.

Since we don't get any content reponse from the website we need to do a time-based sqli.
This means that we'll check if a char exists just like we've done before. 
If so, sleep for x seconds. And then we calculate if there was any delay or not.

In order to do that, I used the exploit we've been using for the last challenges. 
(See python script)

In this challenge we used the following query:

natas18" AND IF(password LIKE BINARY "'+password+char+'%", sleep(10), 1)#

This query says, if the password por natas18 account has the characters given, then sleep for 10 seconds.

The password for natas18 is xvKIqDjy4OPv7wCRgDlmj0pFsCsDjhdP
