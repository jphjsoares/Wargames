In this challenge we have an input field that looks for a username and returns if it exists or not.
So if we look at the code given we can see that the code communicates with a database, although no output from the DB is given, only if it exists or not.
This is basically the same as saying "true" or "false".

We could try to exploit this with blind sql injection in order to get the password!

For that I created a script that looks for the characters that the password contains and then it bruteforces the password using those chars. (Check the python file)

The query looks like this:

"SELECT * WHERE username = 'natas16'" AND PASSWORD LIKE BINARY "%x%"

Being that %x% is any char given.

Just run the script and it's done!
