In this challenge we need to upload a picture with the max size of 1KB.
 
It then creates a random path for that picture using the extension we gave it and creating a random name for it.

Although the code given doesn't actually check if we are giving a picture or not...

So what if we try to give it a php file that shows us the key to the next level (check php file).

Although a .jpg is given to us. That happens because the page code sets the name of the file to (randomName).jpg

But by using burp we can change the extension and get our .php file in the end! :)
