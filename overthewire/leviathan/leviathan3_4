natas3 -> This challenge is really similar to one we've done before.
Using ltrace find the password that the code compares to and then you get a shell! 
Then just type "cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4" and done! -> vuH0coox6m

natas4 -> .trash wasn't here before... If we go to it and run bin we'll get binary numbers.
Let's convert the binary to ascii and voila -> Tith4cokei
