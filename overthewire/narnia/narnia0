As we can see on the source code the program, if val is equal to 0xdeadbeef it will spawn a shell.
So that's our objective!
We need to start figuring out ways to change val. Our only attack vector is through scanf which scans for 24 bytes and puts them in buf.
As we all know, programs use the stack to store anything from variables to functions.
So if we smash the stack using a buffer overflow attack, we can change val , because both of them are on the satck (buf and val).

Let's do the following:

(python -c 'print "A"*20+"\xef\xbe\xad\xde"'; cat) | ./narnia0

We need to use cat in order for the shell to persist, now just do:

cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1
